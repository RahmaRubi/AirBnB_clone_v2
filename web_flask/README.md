Explanation
Redundancy and Maintenance: Notice how each HTML file has a repeated navigation bar. Any change to the navigation structure requires updating every HTML file separately. This can quickly become cumbersome and error-prone as the site grows.
Organizational Challenges: The project structure can become messy with many HTML files for each page or section, and maintaining consistency across them can be difficult.
No Dynamic Content Handling: Without a backend framework, all content is static. Handling dynamic content (like user input or database content) would require additional tools or scripts.
Importance of Flask (or Similar Frameworks)
Using Flask or a similar framework helps in several ways:

Centralized Templates: Flask allows you to create a base template for the navigation bar and other common elements. This ensures consistency and makes updates easier.
Dynamic Content: Flask can handle dynamic content generation, allowing for more interactive and responsive web applications.
URL Routing: Flask routes map URLs to specific functions, keeping the project structure clean and organized.
Separation of Concerns: Flask separates the backend logic from the frontend presentation, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.
